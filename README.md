# CryptoClustering
UCB Data Analysis Bootcamp Module 19 Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Installation

Software Jupyter Notebook is being used to write the code, and to generate the results, and the environment is PythonDataUCB, provided by UC Berkeley.


## Description

This is the Module 19 challenge for the UC Berkeley Data Analyticd Boot Camp. In this challenge, we are using Python and unsupervised machine learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. K-Means and PCA clustering method are used in the process.

The plots during the process are also saved as .png files.
